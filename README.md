# BATTLE BOTS!

## Overview

The year is 4098 and the United Grammar-Loathing Youth Council (UGLY) has launched a "strategic military
operation" in sector 69420 of Galactic Federation Space. 

You are a lone commander of a battalion of battle bots. You see, this war is not waged with marines. 
No, they're far too messy. This war is waged with nuclear-capable BATTLE BOTS<sup>TM</sup>. Hired by the 
Galactic Federation, your task is to annihilate the UGLY forces through moral ambiguity, quick thinking, 
and nuclear weaponry. 

Good luck, Commander. And may God be with you.

## Programming Requirements

- User can save a game to come back later
- Terminal based UI, for now. 
- Goal is to create an engaging RTS that involves typing quickly as a means necessary to repel attacks.
- Maybe there could be a couple different "screens" that just display raw data (maybe a few static pictures) with a 
terminal at the bottom to give commands. Not going for graphics here, just engagement.
- An intro screen where you can load a game in progress or start a new game. 
- The game is beaten when the player successfully builds and launches a Pre-emptive Weaponized Nuclear Education 
Device (PWNED), destroying the opponent's home world. PWN Devices take significant resources to create and launch. 
The user must build their economy and military might in order to gain resources, create more battle bots of varying 
calibres and purposes, and ultimately create and launch PWN Devices. Each PWN Device launch gets the player closer
to the UGLY home world, where one final massacre of grammar-loathing youth will win the game. lol.
- If you're too slow, UGLY will begin taking planets, losing the player resources and setting them back.
If UGLY advances to the player's home world, the player loses. Shows a message that they have been PWNED.
